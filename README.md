# Cryptographically Secure Pseudo-Random Number Generation Using a Robust Chaotic Tent Map: A Novel Approach
This paper presents a novel method for generating Cryptographically Secure Pseudo-Random Numbers (CSPRNG) using a modified version of the chaotic tent map, called the Robust Chaotic Tent Map (RCTM). The authors propose a new set of equations incorporating modulo and scaling operations that significantly expand the usable parameter space from the traditional tent map's limited range to μ ∈ [2, 100]. This modification ensures robust chaotic behavior across the entire parameter range, as verified through bifurcation diagrams and positive Lyapunov exponents. The generated pseudo-random sequences successfully pass multiple rigorous statistical test suites including NIST, ENT, TestU01, and Dieharder, demonstrating their suitability for cryptographic applications. The approach also achieves a larger key space (2^198) compared to existing methods, while offering efficient implementation. This work provides a valuable contribution to secure random number generation for various cryptographic services.
